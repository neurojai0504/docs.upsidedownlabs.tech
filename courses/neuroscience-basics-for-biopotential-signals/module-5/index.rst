Module 5 : The Synapse
#####################################################

A synapse is a junction between two neurons(nerve cells) or between a neuron and another cell, such as muscle or gland cell that allows them to communicate. It is the site where electrical or chemical signals are transmitted from one cell to another.

5.1 Types of synapse
*************************

There are generally 2 main types of synapses : Electrical and Chemical Synapse 

1. Electrical synapse [1]_
=================================

.. todo:: Add diagram

a. Structure
---------------
Formed by gap junctions (channels that connect the cytoplasm of two adjacent neurons) that have pores to allow direct ion flow between the adjacent neurons.

b. Mechanism
----------------

Fast and bidirectional, facilitating rapid signaling and coordination. 

2. Chemical synapse [1]_
==========================

.. todo:: Add diagram

a. Structure
----------------
Consist of a presynaptic neuron (which sends signal) and a postsynaptic neuron (which receives signal), separated by a synaptic cleft. 

b. Mechanism
---------------

- When an action potential(electric signal) reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters(chemical signal) from vesicles into the synaptic cleft. (Synaptic cleft is a very small space between the two neurons which is 20 to 40 nm wide in size)
- These neurotransmitters bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, leading to changes in the postsynaptic neuron (either excitatory or inhibitory).
- Slow in comparison to electrical synapse and unidirectional .

.. admonition:: Note
   
   - For a very long time, scientists believed that electrical synapse is present in whole nervous system (DEVELOPED) but in reality it was chemical synapse which is more common.  
   - As the axon of the presynaptic neuron gets closer to the synapse, it balloons out a little bit and this region is known as presynaptic terminal.

+----------------+---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+

There are 2 major types of receptors : **Ionotropic** and **Metabotropic** receptors. When a neurotransmitter binds to an ionotropic receptor, it causes the receptor to change shape, allowing ions to flow through the channel. This process leads to rapid changes in the postsynaptic membrane potential, resulting in either excitation or inhibition of the neuron. Metabotropic receptors work through chemical signaling pathways inside the cell. These signals can reach the nucleus and switch certain genes on or off. Because of this, metabotropic receptors can change which proteins the cell produces and influence long-term cellular functions.

    - In developing nervous system, electrical synapse is more common. 
    - In developed nervous system, chemical synapse is more common.  

5.2 EPSPs and IPSPs [2]_
**************************

When a chemical synapse releases neurotransmitters, they attach to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. This changes the flow of ions into or out of the neuron, creating small electrical changes called postsynaptic potentials. These shifts slightly raise or lower the membrane potential from its usual resting level of about –70 mV. There are two main types: EPSPs and IPSPs.

Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs)
=============================================

* EPSPs occur when excitatory neurotransmitters-most commonly glutamate - open Na⁺ or Ca²⁺ channels.
* Positive ions enter the neuron, causing depolarization (the membrane becomes less negative).
* This brings the neuron closer to the threshold needed to fire an action potential.
* The size of an EPSP depends on how much neurotransmitter is released, how many receptors are activated, how far the signal is from the axon hillock, and how much it decays along the membrane.
* If enough EPSPs arrive together and push the membrane to about -55 mV at the axon hillock, an action potential is triggered.

Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials (IPSPs)
==============================================

* IPSPs occur when inhibitory neurotransmitters-mainly GABA-open Cl⁻ channels (letting Cl⁻ in) or K⁺ channels (letting K⁺ out).
* This adds more negative charge inside the neuron, causing hyperpolarization, which makes the neuron less likely to fire.
* Like EPSPs, IPSPs are graded (Their size is not fixed - it depends on the strength of the input.) and weaken as they travel toward the axon hillock.

Important Points
-----------------------

* EPSPs and IPSPs are small changes from the –70 mV resting potential caused by shifts in ion permeability and basic electrical forces. :ref:`(Module 2) <neuroscience-basics-for-biopotential-signals-module-2>`
* How far and how strongly they spread depends on membrane resistance (Rm), internal resistance (Ri), capacitance (Cm), the length constant (λ), and the time constant (τ). :ref:`(Module 3) <neuroscience-basics-for-biopotential-signals-module-3>`
* When many EPSPs combine and reach threshold, the neuron fires an action potential. IPSPs work against this process, preventing the membrane from reaching threshold and reducing the chance of firing. :ref:`(Module 4) <neuroscience-basics-for-biopotential-signals-module-4>`

5.3 Bernard katz experiment
*********************************

The Bernard Katz experiment, conducted in the mid-20th century by physiologist Bernard Katz and his colleagues, was pivotal in understanding synaptic transmission, particularly at the neuromuscular junction. Here’s a detailed overview of the experiment and its significance:

5.3.1 Overview of the Experiment
======================================

1. Context
------------
Katz studied the neuromuscular junction in frogs, the place where motor neurons connect with muscle fibers. His goal was to figure out how a nerve signal triggers a muscle to contract.

2. Method
------------
Katz used electrophysiology to study how muscle cells respond electrically when a motor neuron activates them. He measured the postsynaptic potentials in the muscle fibers after stimulating the motor neuron and also observed how changing the calcium ion concentration affected these responses.

3. Findings
----------------
* Katz observed that when the presynaptic neuron releases neurotransmitters (mainly acetylcholine), the muscle fiber produces end-plate potentials (EPPs). End-plate potentials are the small electrical changes produced in muscle fiber when a motor neuron releases neurotransmitters at the neuromuscular junction.
* He noticed that the strength of an EPP changes depending on how many neurotransmitter molecules are released. 
* When he lowered the calcium concentration in the surrounding solution, the EPPs became smaller, showing that calcium is essential for neurotransmitter release.

4. Quantal Release
---------------------
* One of Katz’s major discoveries was the idea of quantal release, meaning neurotransmitters are released in small, fixed packets instead of continuously.
* He confirmed this by studying miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs), which occur even without any stimulation. Miniature end-plate potentials are tiny, spontaneous electrical signals seen in muscle fibers even when the motor neuron is not firing.

5.3.2 Significance : 
========================

Bernard Katz studied the frog neuromuscular junction and discovered that neurotransmitters are released in discrete packets (quanta). Using electrophysiology, he showed that Calcium is essential for neurotransmitter release-lower calcium → smaller EPPs. His findings proved that synaptic transmission is quantized, not continuous, and earned him the Nobel Prize (1970).

5.4 Snare Proteins [3]_
*************************
Snare proteins are special proteins that help a neuron in releasing neurotransmitters. It is of 2 types

* **v-SNAREs (vesicle SNAREs)**: These proteins are located on the synaptic vesicle membrane. The most common v-SNARE is synaptobrevin (also known as VAMP).
* **t-SNAREs (target SNAREs)**: These are found on the presynaptic membrane and interact with v-SNAREs to facilitate vesicle fusion. The main t-SNAREs include syntaxin and SNAP-25.

Mechanism of Action
===========================

1. **Vesicle Docking**: v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs form a complex, bringing the vesicle close to the presynaptic membrane.
2. **Fusion**: Upon the arrival of an action potential, calcium ions enter the presynaptic terminal, triggering the conformational change in the SNARE complex that leads to the fusion of the vesicle with the membrane.
3. **Neurotransmitter Release**: Once the vesicle fuses with the membrane, neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft. 

5.5 Synaptic summation
**************************

Synaptic summation is the way a neuron adds up all the EPSPs and IPSPs it receives from thousands of synapses to decide whether it should fire an action potential. Since each EPSP or IPSP is very small (around 0.2–1 mV), a single synapse is never enough to make the neuron fire. Instead, the neuron relies on the combined effect of many inputs.

5.5.1 Types of synaptic summation
=======================================

There are two main types of summation:

1. Temporal Summation
-----------------------------

Temporal summation happens when several EPSPs or IPSPs arrive one after another in quick succession at the same synapse.

* If they occur close together in time, they add up because the membrane hasn’t returned fully to its resting level.
* This process depends heavily on the time constant (τ):
  
  **a. A longer τ means EPSPs last longer → easier to add up**
  
  **b. A shorter τ means EPSPs fade quickly → harder to summate**

2. Spatial Summation
-----------------------------

Spatial summation occurs when EPSPs or IPSPs arrive at the same time from different synapses located on different parts of the dendrites.

* The inputs from many presynaptic neurons meet at the axon hillock and combine there.
* It depends on the length constant (λ):

  **a. A larger λ allows EPSPs to travel farther with less decay**
  
  **b. A smaller λ causes EPSPs to die out before reaching the hillock**

5.5.2 Interaction of EPSPs and IPSPs
=============================================

* Neurons constantly receive both excitatory and inhibitory signals.
* EPSPs make the cell more positive → increase chance of firing
* IPSPs make the cell more negative → reduce chance of firing
* At the axon hillock, the neuron effectively performs a calculation:

  **Net input = total EPSPs - total IPSPs**
* If this net depolarization reaches about -55 mV → the neuron fires an action potential.
* If inhibition outweighs excitation → no action potential occurs.
  This is the basic way neurons compute information.

5.5.3 How Synaptic Summation Generates Biopotential Signals (EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG)
====================================================================================

Biopotential signals measured from the body—like EEG, ECG, EMG, and EOG—are not recordings of single neurons or single action potentials.
Instead, these signals come from the summed postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs + IPSPs) of thousands to millions of cells firing together. This combined electrical activity creates voltage changes large enough to be detected by electrodes on the skin or scalp.


5.6 Additional info (Toxins and Their Effects)
**************************************************

5.6.1 Botulinum Toxin (Botox)
===================================

**Mechanism**: Botox is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and works by cleaving specific SNARE proteins (primarily SNAP-25).

**Effects**: This prevents vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release, leading to muscle paralysis. Botox is used therapeutically for conditions like muscle spasms and cosmetics procedures by temporarily paralyzing muscles and by reducing the wrinkles and fine lines on skin.

5.6.2 Tetanus Toxin
======================

**Mechanism**: Produced by Clostridium tetani, tetanus toxin also targets SNARE proteins, specifically synaptobrevin.

**Effects**: This toxin inhibits the release of neurotransmitters that mediate inhibitory signals in the nervous system, leading to excessive muscle contraction and spasms (tetanus). It causes a severe and potentially life-threatening condition.

.. admonition:: Bonus info

    **Do rusty nails actually cause tetanus?**

    Rusty nails themselves do not directly cause tetanus. The bacteria that lead to tetanus, Clostridium tetani, are commonly found in soil, animal feces, and dust. While rusty nails can create deep puncture wounds that allow these bacteria to enter the body, it's the bacteria, not the rust, that poses the risk. If a wound becomes contaminated with C. tetani, tetanus can develop, which is why it's important to keep wounds clean and up to date on vaccinations.

5.7 Summary
********************

In module 5, we explored how synapses enable communication between neurons, the difference between electrical and chemical synapses, how neurotransmitters create EPSPs and IPSPs, and how neurons add these signals through synaptic summation. We also learned about quantal release, the role of SNARE proteins, and how toxins affect synaptic function. All of this gives us the foundation to understand how large groups of neurons generate measurable electrical activity. In the next module, we will build on this knowledge and study biopotential signals such as EEG, EMG, ECG, and EOG—how they are produced, how we record them, and what they tell us about the body.
