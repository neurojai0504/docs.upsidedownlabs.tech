Proto Playmate
***************

Proto Playmate offers a flexible prototyping space with a dedicated area for adding your 
own components or circuits. It includes a QWIIC port for quick sensor integration, 
2.54 mm electrode header pins, an ON/OFF slide switch, and a connector interface for electrodes. 
By combining electrodes with custom electronics, users can rapidly prototype biosignal-driven experiments, 
build add-on circuits, or test new designs without needing a separate breadboard.
