Proto Playmate
***************

Proto Playmate offers a flexible prototyping space with a dedicated area for adding your 
own components or circuits. It includes a QWIIC port for quick sensor integration, 
2.54 mm electrode header pins, an ON/OFF slide switch, and a connector interface for electrodes. 
By combining electrodes with custom electronics, users can rapidly prototype biosignal-driven experiments, 
build add-on circuits, or test new designs without needing a separate breadboard.

Using the Kit
********************

This kit makes custom neuroscience projects accessible, enabling beginners to quickly start recording biopotential signals and flexibly integrate their own circuits for compelling HCI/BCI applications. 
The Proto Playmate easily connects to the NPG Lite board, providing a flexible prototyping space for adding custom components, circuits, or testing new designs without complex wiring or needing a separate breadboard.

Step 1: Skin Preparation
=========================

Apply Nuprep skin preparation Gel on the target areas where the
Electrodes will be placed → Rub in circular motion → Clean with an alcohol swab or wet wipe.

For more information, please check out detailed step by step :ref:`Skin Preparation Guide <skin-preparation>`.

Step 2: Connect BioAmp Cables
===============================

Using Proto you can record 3-channel biopotential signals, connect the jumper
wires according to the number of channels required:

Using the Common Negative (CN)
---------------------------------

The Common Negative (CN) is an essential feature, especially when performing multi-channel
recordings like EEG, as it simplifies electrode placement and wiring.

To configure a channel to use the Common Negative, follow these steps:

1. **Choose Your Channels**: Decide which BioAmp channels (A0, A1, A2) you want to share a negative electrode.
2. **Solder the Bridge**: Look for the small solder bridge labeled 'CN' next to the channel's negative pin (A0N, A1N, etc.).
3. **Make it Common:** You must solder this bridge closed. This physically connects that channel's negative input to the main Common Negative line.
4. **Connect the Shared Electrode:** Connect your single, common negative electrode jumper cable to the dedicated CN pin.
5. **Simplify Wiring:** For any channel configured this way, you no longer need to connect an electrode to the corresponding negative input pin (e.g., A0N, A1N, or A2N).
 

Step 3: Place Gel Electrodes
===============================

EMG (Electromyography)
-------------------------

- **1-CH Setup**: Place +ve and -ve cables of Channel 0 on the targeted muscle and REF cable on a bony part (back of the palm or elbow).

- **2-CH Setup**: Place +ve, -ve cables of Channel 0 & 1 on the targeted muscles and 1 REF cable on a bony part.

- **3-CH Setup**:  Place +ve, -ve cables of Channel 0, 1 and 2 on the targeted muscles and 1 REF cable on a bony part.

**Vertical Movement Recording**

- **1-CH Setup**: Place the -ve cable of Channel 0 above either of your eyes, the +ve electrode below same eye, and the REF cable on the bony area behind your earlobe.

- **2-CH Setup**:  To record both horizontal & vertical eye movement together, follow the electrode placements mentioned above for Channels 0 and 1. Make sure to use just 1 REF cable.

Battery Connection Guide
*************************

.. important::
    
    The battery connectors are polarity-sensitive and requires correct connection for safe operation. Incorrect connections will damage the device. Always verify connector polarity before connecting.

Option 1: Battery with 1.25mm PicoBlade Connector
==================================================

If you have purchased your battery from Upside Down Labs, or if have the same ``1.25 mm PicoBlade connector``, you can plug it directly into the battery connector on the NPG Lite.

While connecting the battery:

- Make sure the :bdg-danger:`Red Wire` is connected to the ``Positive (+) terminal``.
- Make sure the :bdg-black:`Black Wire` is connected to the ``Negative (−) terminal``.

This ensures the battery is connected with the correct polarity and prevents damage to the device.

Option 2: Using a Battery with a JST-PH 2.0 mm Connector
=========================================================

If your battery has a ``JST-PH 2.0 mm`` connector, you will need to use the adapter cable included in the NPG Lite kit to connect it.

Follow these steps:

1. Connect the battery to the adapter cable with JST connector: Match the wire colors - ``Red to Red`` and ``Black to Black``.
2. Connect the adapter cable to NPG Lite using the PicoBlade connector:

- Make sure the :bdg-danger:`Red Wire` lines up with the ``Positive (+) terminal``.
- Make sure the :bdg-black:`Black Wire` lines up with the ``Negative (−) terminal`` on the NPG Lite connector.

This ensures the battery is connected with the correct polarity and prevents damage to the device.

    Using Battery with JST-PH 2.0mm Connector

Verifying Battery Polarity with a Multimeter
=============================================

If you are unsure about your battery's polarity, verify it before connection:

- Set your multimeter to measure DC Voltage (V⎓) and select 20V or higher range if it has manual dial.

- Touch the :bdg-danger:`red probe` to the metal terminal of the connector where the :bdg-danger:`red wire` is attached.

- Touch the :bdg-black:`black probe` to the metal terminal where the :bdg-black:`black wire` is attached.

Read the display:

- Positive voltage (e.g., +3.6V to +4.2V): Polarity is correct. ✅
- Negative voltage (e.g., -4.2V): Polarity is reversed. ❌

.. danger:: 
    
    **Safety Reminder:** Double-check all connections before powering ON the device. Wrong battery connection will damage the device.
