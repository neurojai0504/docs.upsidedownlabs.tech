VibZ+ Playmate
*******************

VibZ+ Playmate builds on the VibZ by including an additional 3-channel BioAmp, making it possible to record 
and visualize up to 6 Biosignal channels simultaneously. It retains the vibration motor for haptic feedback, 
buzzer for auditory cues, ON/OFF slide switch, QWIIC port, and electrode connector interface. 
This makes VibZ+ ideal for experiments where higher-resolution input or greater spatial coverage is essential, 
such as multi-channel EEG, EMG, or complex biofeedback applications.

Using the Kit
********************

This kit is designed for advanced biosignal research, enabling users to quickly start recording and visualizing
multi-channel data for high-resolution HCI/BCI experiments.
The VibZ+ Playmate significantly enhances acquisition by including an additional 3-channel BioAmp, allowing 
simultaneous recording of up to six biosignal channels. It retains the vibration motor, buzzer, and QWIIC port, 
making it ideal for multi-channel EEG, EMG, or complex biofeedback applications.


Step 1: Skin Preparation
=========================

Apply Nuprep skin preparation Gel on the target areas where the
Electrodes will be placed → Rub in circular motion → Clean with an alcohol swab or wet wipe.

For more information, please check out detailed step by step :ref:`Skin Preparation Guide <skin-preparation>`.

Step 2: Connect BioAmp Cables
===============================

Using VibZ+ you can record 3-channel biopotential signals, connect the jumper
wires according to the number of channels required:

Using the Common Negative (CN)
---------------------------------

The Common Negative (CN) is an essential feature for multi-channel recordings like EEG, as it simplifies
electrode placement and wiring. This new playmate replaces the previous solder jumpers with a convenient 
slide switch for instant configuration.

*This is the biggest change: No soldering is required. Flipping the switch physically connects all negative inputs to the common line.*

To configure the board to use the Common Negative, follow these steps:

1. **Connect the Shared Electrode:** Connect your single, common negative electrode jumper cable to the dedicated CN pin header.
2. **Locate the Switch:** Find the ``COMMON NEGATIVE`` slide switch on the top of the board. The silkscreen text ``FLIP THE SWCH FOR COMMON NEGATIVE`` points directly to it.
3. **Enable CN mode:** Flip the switch according to the negative channels input pins (A0N, A1N, A2N, A3N, A4N, and A5N). You now only need to connect your positive electrodes (e.g., A0P, A1P, etc.) and the single Common Negative electrode. You can leave all the individual negative pins (A0N-A5N) empty.

Step 3: Place Gel Electrodes
===============================

EMG (Electromyography)
-------------------------

- **1-CH Setup**: Place +ve and -ve cables of Channel 0 on the targeted muscle and REF cable on a bony part (back of the palm or elbow).

- **2-CH Setup**: Place +ve, -ve cables of Channel 0 & 1 on the targeted muscles and 1 REF cable on a bony part.

- **3-CH Setup**:  Place +ve, -ve cables of Channel 0, 1 and 2 on the targeted muscles and 1 REF cable on a bony part.

- **General Multi-Channel Setup:** For any multi-channel recording (2-CH or more), place the +ve cable for each respective channel on the targeted areas, then use only one REF cable and one CN (Common Negative) cable for all channels, placing them on your chosen reference points.

**Vertical Movement Recording**

- **1-CH Setup**: Place the -ve cable of Channel 0 above either of your eyes, the +ve electrode below same eye, and the REF cable on the bony area behind your earlobe.

- **2-CH Setup**:  To record both horizontal & vertical eye movement together, follow the electrode placements mentioned above for Channels 0 and 1. Make sure to use just 1 REF cable.
