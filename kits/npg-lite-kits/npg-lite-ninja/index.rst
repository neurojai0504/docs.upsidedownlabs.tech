VibZ Playmate
*******************

VibZ Playmate introduces a vibration motor for haptic feedback, a buzzer for auditory feedback, 
a QWIIC port for easy I2C sensor integration, an ON/OFF slide switch, 2.54 mm electrode header 
pins and common negative electrode option. With these Playmates, users can customize their setup 
for specific applications, whether in research, education, or interactive biofeedback experiments. 
This modular approach ensures flexibility, scalability, and better user experience.

Using the Kit
********************

This kit is beginner-friendly and you can easily start recording biopotential signals to create compelling 
HCI/BCI projects and explore the field of neuroscience. 
The VibZ Playmate easily connects to the NPG Lite board, providing simple haptic and auditory feedback and
expanding the system for interactive experiments without complex wiring.

Step 1: Skin Preparation
=========================

Apply Nuprep skin preparation Gel on the target areas where the
Electrodes will be placed → Rub in circular motion → Clean with an alcohol swab or wet wipe.

For more information, please check out detailed step by step :ref:`Skin Preparation Guide <skin-preparation>`.

Step 2: Connect BioAmp Cables
===============================

Using VibZ you can record 3-channel biopotential signals, connect the jumper
wires according to the number of channels required:

Using the Common Negative (CN)
---------------------------------

The Common Negative (CN) is an essential feature, especially when performing multi-channel
recordings like EEG, as it simplifies electrode placement and wiring.

To configure a channel to use the Common Negative, follow these steps:

1. **Choose Your Channels**: Decide which BioAmp channels (A0, A1, A2) you want to share a negative electrode.
2. **Solder the Bridge**: Look for the small solder bridge labeled 'CN' next to the channel's negative pin (A0N, A1N, etc.).
3. **Make it Common:** You must solder this bridge closed. This physically connects that channel's negative input to the main Common Negative line.
4. **Connect the Shared Electrode:** Connect your single, common negative electrode jumper cable to the dedicated CN pin.
5. **Simplify Wiring:** For any channel configured this way, you no longer need to connect an electrode to the corresponding negative input pin (e.g., A0N, A1N, or A2N).


Step 3: Place Gel Electrodes
===============================

EMG (Electromyography)
-------------------------

- **1-CH Setup**: Place +ve and -ve cables of Channel 0 on the targeted muscle and REF cable on a bony part (back of the palm or elbow).

- **2-CH Setup**: Place +ve, -ve cables of Channel 0 & 1 on the targeted muscles and 1 REF cable on a bony part.

- **3-CH Setup**:  Place +ve, -ve cables of Channel 0, 1 and 2 on the targeted muscles and 1 REF cable on a bony part.

ECG (Electrocardiogram)
-------------------------

- **1-CH Setup**: Place -ve cable of Channel 0 on the left side of the chest, +ve cable just to its right, and REF cable on the right side of chest.

EOG (Electroculography)
-------------------------

**Horizontal Movement Recording**

- **1-CH Setup**: Place -ve cable of Channel 0 on the right side of your right eye, +ve cable on the left side of the left eye, and REF cable on the bony part at the back side of your earlobe.

**Vertical Movement Recording**

- **1-CH Setup**: Place the -ve cable of Channel 0 above either of your eyes, the +ve electrode below same eye, and the REF cable on the bony area behind your earlobe.

- **2-CH Setup**:  To record both horizontal & vertical eye movement together, follow the electrode placements mentioned above for Channels 0 and 1. Make sure to use just 1 REF cable.
